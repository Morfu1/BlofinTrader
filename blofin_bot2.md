# Implementing a Trading Strategy Using Blofin Demo Account and Python

## Introduction

This documentation guides users through the process of using a Blofin Demo account to implement a trading strategy in a Python-based bot. The strategy involves using SMA 21 and EMA 34 bands to determine entry points. Positions are opened on the first candle after the price closes outside the bands, with configurable take-profit and stop-loss levels based on the band's position.

## Implementation

### Strategy Overview

The strategy involves the following steps:
1. Calculate SMA 21 and EMA 34 bands.
2. Monitor for price closures outside these bands.
3. Open a position on the next candle's opening after the price closes outside the band.
4. Set take-profit and stop-loss levels based on the band's position and configurable percentages.

### Setting Take-Profit and Stop-Loss Levels

For short positions, set the stop-loss above the band (little above the highest wick of the last 10 candles). For long positions, set the stop-loss below the band (a little below lowest wick of the last 10 candles). The take-profit is set at a configurable percentage from the entry point.

### Position Sizing

The position size is configurable, with a default of 100 USD margin. The contract size is adjusted to ensure the position size matches the specified margin amount.


### Configurable Parameters

- **Timeframe**: Choose the desired timeframe (e.g., 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h).
- **Position Size**: Configure the margin size (default is 100 USD).
- **Leverage**: Set the leverage (default is 3x).
- **Position Type**: Choose between isolated or cross margin (default is isolated).
- **Coin Selection**: Select the trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDT).

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to implementing a trading strategy using SMA 21 and EMA 34 bands with a Blofin Demo account and Python. The strategy involves opening positions based on price closures outside the bands and setting configurable take-profit and stop-loss levels.
